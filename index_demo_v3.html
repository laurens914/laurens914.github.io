            <h3>About Hyder</h3>
                <p>Welcome to our town! Hyder, Alaska is a town of about 100 full-time residents located at the southern part of the Southeast Alaskan panhandle. Hyder sits at the head of the Portland Canal on the border of British Columbia. Our Canadian sister town, Stewart, BC (pop. 500), is a five minute drive from Hyder. Getting there is half the fun: it's 40 miles off the main Alaskan highway route on BC 37A, popularly known as the "Glacier Highway." Motorists making the trek will see at least a dozen glaciers from the road, including the spectacular Bear Glacier.</p>

            <h3>A brief history of Hyder</h3>
                <p>Mining has defined our area's economy for a century. Large copper and gold mining operations are still active just outside of Hyder in Canadian territory. During the early days, while prohibition was law in the United States, alcohol was prohibited in hyder and legal in Canada, while "bawdy houses" were prohibited in the Canadian mining camps across the border, but permitted in Hyder. This sparked a lively cross-border economy. It wasn't until the 1970s that a road link from British Columbia connected Hyder and Stewart to the rest of the world. It is now the closest Alaskan town by road from the continental United States, and for road-trippers intent on traveling the Alaska highway, it's become a popular side trip. Attractions include bear viewing, charter fishing, and getting "Hyderized" at the town's main watering hole, which involves drinking a 150-proof shot, and receiving an official certificate.</p>
